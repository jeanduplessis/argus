# Frameworks/

## GhosttyKit.xcframework

`GhosttyKit.xcframework` is **not committed to git** — it's ~150MB+ and
machine-specific. `Frameworks/GhosttyKit.xcframework` is a symlink
(gitignored — never commit it) pointing at a locally-built copy outside the
repo, e.g.:

```
Frameworks/GhosttyKit.xcframework -> ~/.cache/argus/ghosttykit/GhosttyKit.xcframework
```

If that symlink is missing or broken (fresh clone, new machine, or the cache
was cleared), `xcodebuild` fails immediately with:

```
fatal error: 'ghostty.h' file not found
```

because the bridging header (`Argus/Resources/Argus-Bridging-Header.h`)
imports it, and `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS` / `LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS` in
`project.yml` point into the (missing) framework. Run
`scripts/build-ghosttykit.sh` to (re)build it — it automates everything
below end-to-end, pinned to a known-good ghostty commit. The manual
walkthrough is kept for troubleshooting and for understanding what the script
is doing.

**New git worktree?** The symlink is gitignored, so a fresh worktree won't
have it — but the built framework lives in `CACHE_DIR`
(`~/.cache/argus/ghosttykit/`), *outside* the repo and shared across all
worktrees. Just run `scripts/build-ghosttykit.sh`: if the cache already holds
a complete framework it skips the build and only (re)creates the symlink (a
fraction of a second). Pass `--force` to rebuild instead (e.g. after bumping
`GHOSTTY_REF`).

### Building GhosttyKit from source

Ghostty (https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) is written in Zig and
exposes its terminal engine as a C API (`libghostty`). The macOS xcframework
is one of its own build targets.

> **Build a recent ghostty `main`, not the `v1.3.1` tag.** Two things matter
> here that only exist after v1.3.1:
> 1. The exported `ghostty_*` C API carries `GHOSTTY_API` visibility
>    annotations (`__attribute__((visibility("default")))`), so the symbols
>    survive `ReleaseFast` dead-code elimination. On v1.3.1 a `ReleaseFast`
>    xcframework build silently drops **every** `ghostty_*` symbol.
> 2. `src/build/GhosttyLib.zig` combines the bundled dependency archives via
>    `CombineArchivesStep`. A v1.3.1 arm64-only build produced a static lib
>    missing large chunks of the bundled deps (FreeType, spirv-cross,
>    oniguruma, ...), so Argus failed to link.
>
> The script pins `GHOSTTY_REF` to a known-good `main` commit (`1.3.2-dev`).
> That commit is also the API `Argus/Ghostty/*.swift` is written against —
> see "Keeping Argus in sync" below before bumping it.

**1. Get the exact Zig version Ghostty pins to.**

Check `build.zig.zon`'s `minimum_zig_version` in the Ghostty checkout — as
of the pinned commit this is `0.15.2`. Zig has no backwards compatibility
guarantees across minor versions, so it must match exactly; Homebrew's `zig`
formula is usually newer and will fail to even parse Ghostty's `build.zig`.

```bash
curl -fsSL -o zig.tar.xz \
  "https://ziglang.org/download/0.15.2/zig-aarch64-macos-0.15.2.tar.xz"
# Verify against the sha256 published in https://ziglang.org/download/index.json
# before running it as your build toolchain (build-ghosttykit.sh does this for you):
shasum -a 256 -c - <<<"3cc2bab367e185cdfb27501c4b30b1b0653c28d9f73df8dc91488e66ece5fa6b  zig.tar.xz"
tar xf zig.tar.xz
ZIG=./zig-aarch64-macos-0.15.2/zig
```

(Use `zig-x86_64-macos-0.15.2.tar.xz` on Intel — sha256
`375b6909fc1495d16fc2c7db9538f707456bfc3373b14ee83fdd3e22b3d43f7f`.)

**2. Fetch the pinned Ghostty commit.**

`GHOSTTY_REF` is a commit SHA, so fetch it explicitly (shallow is fine — the
version comes from `build.zig.zon`, and deps are fetched by the Zig package
manager at build time, no git submodules):

```bash
REF=88b4cd047fa627cdca6781bc7e7dc8b75a2cecb9   # ghostty main, 1.3.2-dev
mkdir ghostty && cd ghostty
git init -q
git remote add origin https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty.git
git fetch --depth 1 origin "$REF"
git checkout FETCH_HEAD
```

**3. Work around Zig 0.15.2 vs. new macOS SDKs.**

Zig 0.15.2's Mach-O linker can fail to parse the `.tbd` library stubs in
very new macOS SDKs, breaking *any* build (not just Ghostty's) with errors
like:

```
error: undefined symbol: _abort
error: undefined symbol: __availability_version_check
```

If you hit this, check whether an older SDK is available alongside your
current Xcode's Command Line Tools:

```bash
ls /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/
```

If there's an older `MacOSX*.sdk` there (e.g. `MacOSX15.4.sdk`), point Zig
at it — but pick an actual versioned directory, not one of the `MacOSX.sdk`
/ `MacOSX26.sdk` shortcut symlinks, which just point back at the newest SDK
(the one causing the problem). Zig always resolves the SDK via
`xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-path` internally and doesn't honor
`SDKROOT`, so shim `xcrun` in `PATH`:

```bash
mkdir -p fakebin
cat > fakebin/xcrun <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
if [[ "$*" == *"--sdk macosx --show-sdk-path"* ]]; then
    echo "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX15.4.sdk"
    exit 0
fi
exec /usr/bin/xcrun "$@"
EOF
chmod +x fakebin/xcrun
```

Prefix subsequent commands with `PATH="$(pwd)/fakebin:$PATH"`. Skip this
entirely if a plain `$ZIG build` links fine for you.

**4. Install the Metal Toolchain, if needed.**

Recent Xcode versions ship the Metal shader compiler as an optional
download. If the build fails with:

```
error: cannot execute tool 'metal' due to missing Metal Toolchain
```

run:

```bash
xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain
```

**5. Build the xcframework (arm64-only, ReleaseFast).**

```bash
PATH="$(pwd)/fakebin:$PATH" "$ZIG" build \
  -Doptimize=ReleaseFast \
  -Demit-xcframework=true \
  -Demit-macos-app=false \
  -Dxcframework-target=native
```

- `-Dxcframework-target=native` builds an **arm64-only** framework. Argus is
  arm64-only (see `project.yml`'s `ARCHS` and `AGENTS.md` — single machine,
  not distributed), so this skips the x86_64 slice and the lipo/universal
  path entirely. Drop this flag to build a universal `macos-arm64_x86_64`
  slice instead (and point `project.yml` back at that slice path).
- `-Demit-macos-app=false` skips the full `Ghostty.app` bundle — that also
  links an x86_64 app binary, which can fail for reasons unrelated to the
  library (e.g. no Rosetta toolchain). We only need `libghostty`.
- `-Doptimize=ReleaseFast`, **not `Debug`**: a Debug build keeps Ghostty's
  internal `Page.verifyIntegrity()` consistency checks and a
  stack-trace-capturing safety allocator on the hot path — every line op
  (erase, scroll, attribute set) re-verifies and re-hashes the page. That's
  invisible for occasional keystrokes but pegs a CPU core at 100% on any
  surface receiving a steady stream of redraws (a TUI spinner, a busy build
  log), because the `io-reader` thread never catches up. On this (post-1.3.1)
  ghostty the exported C API survives `ReleaseFast` thanks to the
  `GHOSTTY_API` annotations. `Argus.app` itself can still be built in Debug —
  the xcframework is a separate compiled artifact, so you keep Swift-side
  debuggability. Only fall back to `Debug` here if you need to debug a crash
  inside Ghostty's own Zig code.

Output lands at `macos/GhosttyKit.xcframework`, with the combined static lib
at `macos-arm64/libghostty-internal-fat.a`.

**6. Vendor it.** (`scripts/build-ghosttykit.sh` does steps 1-6 for you,
pinned to a known-good `GHOSTTY_REF`/`ZIG_VERSION` — override those env vars
to bump the pinned version.)

Copy the built framework somewhere outside the repo and symlink it in.

```bash
CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/argus/ghosttykit"
mkdir -p "$CACHE_DIR"
rm -rf "$CACHE_DIR/GhosttyKit.xcframework"
cp -R macos/GhosttyKit.xcframework "$CACHE_DIR/GhosttyKit.xcframework"

# project.yml links `-lghostty`, which expects `libghostty.a`. A native
# arm64-only build names the combined archive `libghostty-internal-fat.a`;
# alias it:
macos_slice="$CACHE_DIR/GhosttyKit.xcframework/macos-arm64"
( cd "$macos_slice" && ln -sf libghostty-internal-fat.a libghostty.a )

cd /path/to/argus
rm -f Frameworks/GhosttyKit.xcframework
ln -s "$CACHE_DIR/GhosttyKit.xcframework" Frameworks/GhosttyKit.xcframework
```

**7. Sanity-check the archive is complete**, so a silently-incomplete build
fails here instead of at Argus link time:

```bash
LIB="$CACHE_DIR/GhosttyKit.xcframework/macos-arm64/libghostty-internal-fat.a"
nm "$LIB" | grep " _ghostty_app_new$"       # core C API
nm "$LIB" | grep " _spvc_context_create$"   # a bundled dependency symbol
```

Both must print a `T`/`D` (defined) line. If either is only `U` (undefined)
or missing, the build is incomplete — you're almost certainly on `v1.3.1`
instead of `main` (see the note at the top).

### Keeping Argus's Swift code in sync with Ghostty's C API

Argus's `Argus/Ghostty/*.swift` wrappers are written against the pinned
`GHOSTTY_REF` above. They were originally adapted from a cmux fork of Ghostty
to vanilla upstream; those drifts are **already applied** and are noted here
only as reference for anyone bumping `GHOSTTY_REF`:

- `ghostty_surface_config_s` has no `io_mode` field upstream (the
  `GHOSTTY_SURFACE_IO_EXEC` assignment was removed in `TerminalSurface.swift`
  — leaving `command` unset already gets Ghostty to exec the default shell).
- `ghostty_runtime_read_clipboard_cb` returns `Bool` upstream (`true` if the
  clipboard request was started; `GhosttyCallbacks.swift`'s
  `ghosttyReadClipboardCallback` returns a matching value).

Bumping `GHOSTTY_REF` may surface new C API drifts as Swift compile errors.
Diff `macos-arm64/Headers/ghostty.h` in the built framework against the
previous one, and cross-reference the failing symbol against
`macos/Sources/Ghostty/Ghostty.App.swift` in the Ghostty checkout — that's
Ghostty's own reference Swift integration and shows the current expected
usage.
