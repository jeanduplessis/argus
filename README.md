# Argus

Argus is a personal macOS terminal workspace manager built on Ghostty. It keeps terminals, browser pages, files, Git previews, Projects, and Git worktrees in one native application.

The current repository is the stable v1 baseline used for day-to-day development. It is a personal tool, not a distributed product.

## Current scope

V1 includes:

- Ghostty-backed terminal tabs and split panes;
- Projects, Standalone Workspaces, and Managed Worktrees;
- a Files View with File Tabs;
- a Changes View with Git mutations, diff, and blame previews;
- Browser Panels;
- global Settings;
- session restore for Projects, Workspaces, and Terminal Panels;
- process-local Agent Status presentation.

The Companion CLI is a scaffold. V1 does not include a Socket Server, socket-backed CLI commands, coding-agent integrations, notifications, PID tracking, or TTS. Accepted future work is kept under `docs/proposals/`.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 or later
- Xcode 16 or later
- Swift 6
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)
- [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) for repository validation
- the vendored `Frameworks/GhosttyKit.xcframework`

Node.js is needed only when rebuilding the committed Pierre diff renderer bundle.

Install the development tools with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install xcodegen swiftlint
```

## Build and run

```sh
./scripts/build.sh run
```

Run the complete validation suite with:

```sh
./scripts/test.sh
```

See `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for setup, build commands, generated assets, and test organization.

## Documentation

Documents have distinct roles:

1. `docs/SPEC.md` defines current stable behavior.
2. `docs/UI_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` defines UI interaction and presentation rules.
3. `CONTEXT.md` defines canonical domain language and ownership boundaries.
4. `docs/adrs/` records accepted architecture decisions and their consequences; its README defines the record format.
5. `docs/proposals/` contains future changes. Proposals do not describe current behavior until implemented and promoted into the spec.
6. `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` and `docs/RELEASING.md` contain operational instructions.
7. `AGENTS.md` contains repository instructions for coding agents.

## Local data

- Session Snapshot: `~/Library/Application Support/Argus/session.json`
- Managed Worktrees: `~/.argus/worktrees/<project-uuid>/<branch-slug>/`
- Reserved socket path: `~/.argus/argus.sock`

The socket path is injected into Terminal Panels for forward compatibility, but no process listens there in v1.
