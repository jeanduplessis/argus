# Context

## Scope

Argus is a personal, single-process macOS terminal workspace manager. This
contract defines domain language and ownership boundaries for workspace,
worktree, terminal, repository-status, UI, persistence, IPC, and agent behavior.

## Contexts

| Context | Owns | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Work Mode organization** | Application-level Work Mode selection; independent Code Work Mode and Review Work Mode navigation, center content, Right Sidebar, and restoration state; and Code Work Mode ownership of Projects, Workspaces, Panels, top-level tabs, panes, ordering, selection, and focus | `Argus/Models/Project.swift`, `Argus/Models/Workspace.swift`, `Argus/Models/Panel.swift`, `Argus/Services/WorkspaceManager.swift`, future work under `docs/proposals/work-modes-review/` | Global Settings and Project identity remain shared across Work Modes. UUIDs are identity; display names are not keys. |
| **Worktree management** | Repository validation, branch discovery, worktree creation/removal, managed storage, and orphan discovery | `Argus/Services/WorktreeService.swift` | All git operations use spawned `git` processes; no libgit2. |
| **Terminal runtime** | Global Ghostty engine, terminal surfaces, shell processes, rendering, terminal input, and first-responder behavior | `Argus/Ghostty/`, `Argus/Models/TerminalPanel.swift` | One global `GhosttyApp`; one Terminal Surface per Terminal Panel. |
| **Files and Changes** | Right-sidebar navigation, workspace file tree, Git status snapshot, change actions, filesystem item actions, and file/preview loading | `Argus/Views/GitSidebar/`, `Argus/Models/GitStatus.swift`, `Argus/Services/GitStatus*`, `Argus/Services/GitPreviewService.swift` | Git Status Root never follows a terminal's live working directory. |
| **User interface** | Single-window surface placement, tab behavior, interaction affordances, chrome, and accessibility contract | `Argus/Views/`, `docs/UI_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` | Inspectable content belongs in Workspace tabs, not independent windows. |
| **Session persistence** | Session snapshots, restore validation, Project/Workspace reconciliation, and sidebar preferences | `Argus/Models/SessionSnapshot.swift`, `Argus/Services/WorkspaceManager.swift`, `Argus/Views/Sidebar/SidebarState.swift` | Durable state and ephemeral runtime state must remain distinct. |
| **Agent status and integrations** | In-process Agent Status display, Turn Completion Attention, Socket Server routing, and external integration setup | `Argus/Services/AgentStatusStore.swift`, `Argus/Services/TurnCompletionAttentionStore.swift`, `Argus/Services/AgentSocketServer.swift`, `ArgusCLI/` | The Socket Server implements only `agent.turnCompleted`; the Companion CLI remains a scaffold. |

|---|---|---|---|
| **Argus Application** | Native macOS app process that owns all authoritative domain state, UI, and persistence. | Referring to the app or its process-wide behavior. | "server process", "daemon", "backend". |
| **Work Mode (Code Work Mode and Review Work Mode)** | Application-level environment selected from the left-sidebar header. Each Work Mode independently owns its sidebar hierarchy and selection, center tabs, Right Sidebar state, and restoration state.

## Relationships

- The Argus Application owns one `WorkspaceManager`, one global `GhosttyApp`, and the process-wide Socket Server used by implemented integrations.
- The Argus Application has one selected Work Mode. Code Work Mode and Review Work Mode independently own navigation selection, center tabs, Right Sidebar state, and restoration state while sharing global Settings and Named Project identity.
- A Named Project references an ordered set of Workspaces by Workspace ID.
- A Project may be created from Repository Identity for Review Work Mode without cloning. It appears in Code Work Mode only after a local checkout and Workspace are configured.
- In the first Review Work Mode release, a Pull Request is hosted by GitHub and all authenticated provider operations use the active GitHub CLI authentication context; Argus does not own or persist GitHub credentials.
- Review Work Mode discovers the active account's Review Inbox and groups Pull Requests by Project. Pull Requests with durable user intent or local review state become Saved Pull Requests and are not removed by Inbox synchronization.
- The Catch-all Project groups Standalone Workspaces and is ordered after Named Projects.
- A Workspace has one Workspace Root, owns all of its Panels, orders top-level Panel roots as Top-level Tabs, and stores one split layout per Top-level Tab.
- A Top-level Tab contains one or more Pane leaves; closing the tab closes every Panel in its layout.
- A Terminal Panel owns exactly one Terminal Surface, and their UUIDs are equal during that runtime session.
- A Browser Panel owns browser state, follows the normal top-level tab lifecycle, and must not steal focus while its tab is in the background.
- The Selected Workspace contains one Active Tab, and the Active Tab contains one Focused Pane.
- A Main-checkout Workspace resolves its Git Status Root from its Named Project's Project Repository Root.
- A Worktree Workspace resolves its Git Status Root from its worktree path.
- A Standalone Workspace resolves its Git Status Root from its Workspace Root.
- A Git File Change belongs to one Change Section; one path may have separate Staged and Unstaged entries.
- A File Tab and Git Preview Tab belong to the Workspace that initiated them and use that Workspace's normal tab lifecycle.
- A Pull Request Review Tab belongs to Review Work Mode rather than a Code Workspace. One Pull Request has at most one open review tab, and changed-file selection remains inside that tab.
- A Pull Request Review Tab reads one Review Revision at a time. A newer remote head is announced but does not replace the loaded revision until the user explicitly updates.
- A Pending Review belongs to one Pull Request and Review Revision. Existing-conversation replies publish separately; new inline comments publish with the Pending Review and its Review Disposition.
- A Per-panel Agent Status overrides Workspace-level Agent Status for the same terminal context.
- The Session Snapshot persists Code Work Mode state. Review Session State persists Review Work Mode state independently. Agent Status Entries, agent PIDs, Git Status Snapshots, and socket connections are ephemeral.

## Agent Rules

- Read `docs/SPEC.md` before changing behavior; it governs correctness.
- Read `docs/UI_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` before changing UI behavior or placement.
- Use Project ID, Workspace ID, and Panel ID for identity; never use a mutable display name as a key.
- Use `~/.argus/worktrees/<project-uuid>/<branch-slug>/` for Managed Worktree paths.
- Use **Standalone Workspace** in prose; `WorkspaceType.external` is a legacy code spelling, not the canonical concept name.
- Do not infer git scope from Terminal Working Directory; resolve and pass the Git Status Root.
- Do not assume every Workspace has a git context; a Standalone Workspace may be an ordinary directory.
- Do not use Panel, Top-level Tab, Pane, and Terminal Surface interchangeably.
- Say **Selected Workspace**, **Active Tab**, and **Focused Pane** for their distinct state levels.
- Qualify "status" as Git Status Snapshot, Git File Status, Agent Status Entry, or a specific load state.
- Qualify "notification" as Agent Notification, Foundation Notification, macOS notification, or TTS announcement.
- Qualify "root" as Workspace Root, Project Repository Root, Git Status Root, or managed storage root.
- Qualify "file tree" as Workspace File Tree or Change Tree.
- Use **Workspace Item Operation** for Files View actions and **Git Mutation** or **Change Action** for Changes View actions.
- Keep inspectable content in Workspace tabs; do not introduce an independent content window without changing the spec and UI contract.
- Preserve the initiating Workspace across asynchronous file, status, and preview work; completion must not redirect global selection.
- Keep durable domain state in models/managers and I/O behavior in services; views may own transient presentation state only.
- Use spawned `git` commands for git behavior and FSEvents for recursive repository watching.
- Keep the Companion CLI transport-only; it must not read session files or own application state.
- Socket and telemetry requests must not activate the app or change focus unless the request explicitly selects a Workspace or focuses a Panel.
- Resolve environment fallbacks such as `ARGUS_SURFACE_ID` in the client or integration before sending a Socket Request.
- Treat Agent Status Entries and agent PIDs as ephemeral; never restore them from a Session Snapshot.
- Do not cache Surface IDs across application restarts.
- Use global sidebar order for Workspace Number; never calculate it per Project.
- When current code and the spec disagree, treat it as contract drift and reconcile both before changing behavior.

## Ambiguities

| Ambiguous term or conflict | Problem | Canonical decision |
|---|---|---|
| Project vs repository | A Project is an application aggregate; a repository is its hosted or local Git resource. | Use **Project** for aggregate behavior, **Repository Identity** for hosted identity, and **Project Repository Root** for a local checkout path. Use **Named Project** when current stable Code Work Mode behavior requires a local checkout. |
| Project identity across Work Modes | Review can know a hosted repository before Code has a local checkout, while the stable Named Project model currently requires a Project Repository Root. | Use one Project ID and Repository Identity across Work Modes. Do not clone implicitly or create duplicate Projects; add local checkout state only when Code Work Mode is configured. |
| Workspace vs worktree | A Workspace may be mistaken for its backing checkout. | A Workspace always has a Workspace Root; only Worktree Workspaces map to secondary git worktrees, and Standalone Workspaces may have no git context. |
| Panel vs tab vs pane vs surface | Current comments and APIs sometimes use these as synonyms. | Use layout and runtime definitions in Canonical Terms; a Panel can back a Top-level Tab or Pane, while only Terminal Panels own Terminal Surfaces. |
| `currentDirectory` | Name suggests live shell PWD but implementation uses it as stable Workspace filesystem context. | Call it **Workspace Root** in prose; use **Terminal Working Directory** for live PWD. |
| Right git sidebar | Current UI hosts Files and Changes, while spec and persistence names still assume git-only content. | Use **Right Sidebar** for the column and **Changes View** for Git status; retain legacy code keys only where migration requires them. |
| File tree | Files and Changes build unrelated hierarchies. | Use **Workspace File Tree** for filesystem enumeration and **Change Tree** for grouped changed paths. |
| Status | Means repository summary, per-file kind, agent telemetry, or load state. | Always use a qualified canonical status term. |
| Repository root | Can mean checkout root, `.git`, common dir, Workspace Root, or Git Status Root. | Name the exact root; **Project Repository Root** is checkout top-level, not git metadata. |
| External | `WorkspaceType.external` means Standalone Workspace, while an External Worktree is an existing worktree outside managed storage. | Use **Standalone Workspace** and **External Worktree** as separate concepts. |
| Preview panel | `GitPreviewPanel` is a Panel model, not an AppKit presentation surface. | User-facing concept is **Git Preview Tab**; no floating preview window. |
| Selection and focus | "Active" is used for Workspace, tab, Panel, and first responder. | Use Selected Workspace, Active Tab, Focused Pane, and AppKit first responder separately. |
| Empty Workspace | Spec says replacement is "empty" but every new Workspace starts with one Terminal Panel. | "Empty" means fresh/default Workspace, not zero Panels. |
| Split panes | A Top-level Tab and its terminal Pane layout are distinct layers. | A Top-level Tab may own a split tree of terminal Panes. |
| Diff/blame presentation | Git Preview content could be confused with a transient preview surface. | Use **Git Preview Tab** in the initiating Workspace. |
| Panel taxonomy | Historical docs described Terminal/Browser only. | Treat Panel as extensible; v1 implements Terminal, Browser, File, and Git Preview Panels. |
| Managed path identity | Managed Worktree paths need a stable Project partition. | Project UUID is the canonical path partition: `<project-uuid>/<branch-slug>`. |
| Catch-all membership | Fresh Standalone Workspaces may have nil `projectId`; restore reconciliation may assign Catch-all Project ID. | Unresolved data-model inconsistency; use Catch-all Project membership conceptually and do not change reference authority without a dedicated decision. |
| Worktree ownership | `WorkspaceType.worktree` does not distinguish Managed Worktree from External Worktree, yet deletion behavior depends on ownership. | Unresolved model gap; never infer safe deletion solely from workspace type or non-nil worktree path. |
| Branch collision | Branch names and Managed Worktree storage slugs have different collision behavior. | V1 rejects duplicate branch names; only storage-path slug collisions receive numeric suffixes. |
| Files feature authority | Files View and File Tab behavior includes global preferences whose scope must not be inferred from general Files semantics. | `docs/SPEC.md` defines both stable Files behavior and the limited scope of Files defaults. |
| Panel persistence | Persistence requirements differ by Panel type. | V1 restores Terminal Panels and their Terminal Working Directories; Browser, File, Git Preview, split layout, and tab/focus state are runtime-only. |
| Socket wire schema | V1 reserves a socket path but implements no wire protocol. | Do not infer a schema from planned CLI command names; define and test it in a proposal before implementation. |
| Agent notification | Could mean IPC event, Foundation event, macOS notification, TTS, or deferred in-app history. | Use the qualified notification terms in Canonical Terms. |

## Context Boundaries

- **Work Mode organization** owns Work Mode selection and independent state. Its Code Work Mode ownership includes Project and Workspace identity, membership, ordering, Panel lifecycle, and selection state.
- **Worktree management** owns repository validation, branch operations, Managed Worktree creation/removal, managed storage, and orphan cleanup; it does not own Workspace Item Operations or Git Mutations.
- **Terminal runtime** owns Ghostty resources and shell state; Code Work Mode organization references terminal runtime through Terminal Panels and IDs.
- **Files and Changes** owns Workspace Item Operations and Git Mutations, may read Workspace context, must resolve I/O roots explicitly, and publishes inspectable content through Workspace tab APIs.
- **User interface** owns presentation and transient interaction state, not repository, worktree, Workspace, or session truth.
- **Session persistence** owns serialized durable state and reconciliation; it must exclude live process, socket, Git status, and Agent status state.
- Future integration proposals must keep the Companion CLI transport-only, the Socket Server app-owned, and authoritative domain state in the Argus Application.
- Cross-context references use stable IDs and explicit service APIs; views must not infer identity from labels or paths.
