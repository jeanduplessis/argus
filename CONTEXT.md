# Context

## Scope

Argus is a personal, single-process macOS terminal workspace manager. This
contract defines domain language and ownership boundaries for workspace,
worktree, terminal, repository-status, UI, persistence, IPC, and agent behavior.

## Contexts

| Context | Owns | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Workspace organization** | Projects, Workspaces, Panels, top-level tabs, panes, ordering, selection, and focus model | `Argus/Models/Project.swift`, `Argus/Models/Workspace.swift`, `Argus/Models/Panel.swift`, `Argus/Services/WorkspaceManager.swift` | UUIDs are identity; display names are not keys. |
| **Worktree management** | Repository validation, branch discovery, worktree creation/removal, managed storage, and orphan discovery | `Argus/Services/WorktreeService.swift` | All git operations use spawned `git` processes; no libgit2. |
| **Terminal runtime** | Global Ghostty engine, terminal surfaces, shell processes, rendering, terminal input, and first-responder behavior | `Argus/Ghostty/`, `Argus/Models/TerminalPanel.swift` | One global `GhosttyApp`; one Terminal Surface per Terminal Panel. |
| **Files and Changes** | Right-sidebar navigation, workspace file tree, Git status snapshot, change actions, filesystem item actions, and file/preview loading | `Argus/Views/GitSidebar/`, `Argus/Models/GitStatus.swift`, `Argus/Services/GitStatus*`, `Argus/Services/GitPreviewService.swift` | Git Status Root never follows a terminal's live working directory. |
| **User interface** | Single-window surface placement, tab behavior, interaction affordances, chrome, and accessibility contract | `Argus/Views/`, `docs/UI_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` | Inspectable content belongs in Workspace tabs, not independent windows. |
| **Session persistence** | Session snapshots, restore validation, Project/Workspace reconciliation, and sidebar preferences | `Argus/Models/SessionSnapshot.swift`, `Argus/Services/WorkspaceManager.swift`, `Argus/Views/Sidebar/SidebarState.swift` | Durable state and ephemeral runtime state must remain distinct. |
| **Agent status and future integrations** | In-process Agent Status display plus proposed external integration boundaries | `Argus/Services/AgentStatusStore.swift`, `ArgusCLI/`, `docs/proposals/` | V1 has no Socket Server or functional Companion CLI commands. |

## Relationships

- The Argus Application owns one `WorkspaceManager` and one global `GhosttyApp`. A Socket Server is proposed but not implemented in v1.
- A Named Project references an ordered set of Workspaces by Workspace ID.
- The Catch-all Project groups Standalone Workspaces and is ordered after Named Projects.
- A Workspace has one Workspace Root, owns all of its Panels, orders top-level Panel roots as Top-level Tabs, and stores one split layout per Top-level Tab.
- A Top-level Tab contains one or more Pane leaves; closing the tab closes every Panel in its layout.
- A Terminal Panel owns exactly one Terminal Surface, and their UUIDs are equal during that runtime session.
- A Browser Panel owns browser state, follows the normal top-level tab lifecycle, and must not steal focus while its tab is in the background.
- The Selected Workspace contains one Active Tab, and the Active Tab contains one Focused Pane.
- A Main-checkout Workspace resolves its Git Status Root from its Named Project's Project Repository Root.
- A Worktree Workspace resolves its Git Status Root from its worktree path.
- A Standalone Workspace resolves its Git Status Root from its Workspace Root.
- A Git File Change belongs to one Change Section; one path may have separate Staged and Unstaged entries.
- A File Tab and Git Preview Tab belong to the Workspace that initiated them and use that Workspace's normal tab lifecycle.
- A Per-panel Agent Status overrides Workspace-level Agent Status for the same terminal context.
- A Session Snapshot persists durable application state; Agent Status Entries, agent PIDs, Git Status Snapshots, and socket connections are ephemeral.

## Agent Rules

- Read `docs/SPEC.md` before changing behavior; it governs correctness.
- Read `docs/UI_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` before changing UI behavior or placement.
- Use Project ID, Workspace ID, and Panel ID for identity; never use a mutable display name as a key.
- Use `~/.argus/worktrees/<project-uuid>/<branch-slug>/` for Managed Worktree paths.
- Use **Standalone Workspace** in prose; `WorkspaceType.external` is a legacy code spelling, not the canonical concept name.
- Do not infer git scope from Terminal Working Directory; resolve and pass the Git Status Root.
- Do not assume every Workspace has a git context; a Standalone Workspace may be an ordinary directory.
- Do not use Panel, Top-level Tab, Pane, and Terminal Surface interchangeably.
- Say **Selected Workspace**, **Active Tab**, and **Focused Pane** for their distinct state levels.
- Qualify "status" as Git Status Snapshot, Git File Status, Agent Status Entry, or a specific load state.
- Qualify "notification" as Agent Notification, Foundation Notification, macOS notification, or TTS announcement.
- Qualify "root" as Workspace Root, Project Repository Root, Git Status Root, or managed storage root.
- Qualify "file tree" as Workspace File Tree or Change Tree.
- Use **Workspace Item Operation** for Files View actions and **Git Mutation** or **Change Action** for Changes View actions.
- Keep inspectable content in Workspace tabs; do not introduce an independent content window without changing the spec and UI contract.
- Preserve the initiating Workspace across asynchronous file, status, and preview work; completion must not redirect global selection.
- Keep durable domain state in models/managers and I/O behavior in services; views may own transient presentation state only.
- Use spawned `git` commands for git behavior and FSEvents for recursive repository watching.
- Keep the Companion CLI transport-only; it must not read session files or own application state.
- Socket and telemetry requests must not activate the app or change focus unless the request explicitly selects a Workspace or focuses a Panel.
- Resolve environment fallbacks such as `ARGUS_SURFACE_ID` in the client or integration before sending a Socket Request.
- Treat Agent Status Entries and agent PIDs as ephemeral; never restore them from a Session Snapshot.
- Do not cache Surface IDs across application restarts.
- Use global sidebar order for Workspace Number; never calculate it per Project.
- When current code and the spec disagree, treat it as contract drift and reconcile both before changing behavior.

## Ambiguities

| Ambiguous term or conflict | Problem | Canonical decision |
|---|---|---|
| Project vs repository | A Project is an application aggregate; a repository is its git resource. | Use **Named Project** for aggregate behavior and **Project Repository Root** for checkout path. |
| Workspace vs worktree | A Workspace may be mistaken for its backing checkout. | A Workspace always has a Workspace Root; only Worktree Workspaces map to secondary git worktrees, and Standalone Workspaces may have no git context. |
| Panel vs tab vs pane vs surface | Current comments and APIs sometimes use these as synonyms. | Use layout and runtime definitions in Canonical Terms; a Panel can back a Top-level Tab or Pane, while only Terminal Panels own Terminal Surfaces. |
| `currentDirectory` | Name suggests live shell PWD but implementation uses it as stable Workspace filesystem context. | Call it **Workspace Root** in prose; use **Terminal Working Directory** for live PWD. |
| Right git sidebar | Current UI hosts Files and Changes, while spec and persistence names still assume git-only content. | Use **Right Sidebar** for the column and **Changes View** for Git status; retain legacy code keys only where migration requires them. |
| File tree | Files and Changes build unrelated hierarchies. | Use **Workspace File Tree** for filesystem enumeration and **Change Tree** for grouped changed paths. |
| Status | Means repository summary, per-file kind, agent telemetry, or load state. | Always use a qualified canonical status term. |
| Repository root | Can mean checkout root, `.git`, common dir, Workspace Root, or Git Status Root. | Name the exact root; **Project Repository Root** is checkout top-level, not git metadata. |
| External | `WorkspaceType.external` means Standalone Workspace, while an External Worktree is an existing worktree outside managed storage. | Use **Standalone Workspace** and **External Worktree** as separate concepts. |
| Preview panel | `GitPreviewPanel` is a Panel model, not an AppKit presentation surface. | User-facing concept is **Git Preview Tab**; no floating preview window. |
| Selection and focus | "Active" is used for Workspace, tab, Panel, and first responder. | Use Selected Workspace, Active Tab, Focused Pane, and AppKit first responder separately. |
| Empty Workspace | Spec says replacement is "empty" but every new Workspace starts with one Terminal Panel. | "Empty" means fresh/default Workspace, not zero Panels. |
| Split panes | A Top-level Tab and its terminal Pane layout are distinct layers. | A Top-level Tab may own a split tree of terminal Panes. |
| Diff/blame presentation | Git Preview content could be confused with a transient preview surface. | Use **Git Preview Tab** in the initiating Workspace. |
| Panel taxonomy | Historical docs described Terminal/Browser only. | Treat Panel as extensible; v1 implements Terminal, Browser, File, and Git Preview Panels. |
| Managed path identity | Managed Worktree paths need a stable Project partition. | Project UUID is the canonical path partition: `<project-uuid>/<branch-slug>`. |
| Catch-all membership | Fresh Standalone Workspaces may have nil `projectId`; restore reconciliation may assign Catch-all Project ID. | Unresolved data-model inconsistency; use Catch-all Project membership conceptually and do not change reference authority without a dedicated decision. |
| Worktree ownership | `WorkspaceType.worktree` does not distinguish Managed Worktree from External Worktree, yet deletion behavior depends on ownership. | Unresolved model gap; never infer safe deletion solely from workspace type or non-nil worktree path. |
| Branch collision | Branch names and Managed Worktree storage slugs have different collision behavior. | V1 rejects duplicate branch names; only storage-path slug collisions receive numeric suffixes. |
| Files feature authority | Files View and File Tab behavior includes global preferences whose scope must not be inferred from general Files semantics. | `docs/SPEC.md` defines both stable Files behavior and the limited scope of Files defaults. |
| Panel persistence | Persistence requirements differ by Panel type. | V1 restores Terminal Panels and their Terminal Working Directories; Browser, File, Git Preview, split layout, and tab/focus state are runtime-only. |
| Socket wire schema | V1 reserves a socket path but implements no wire protocol. | Do not infer a schema from planned CLI command names; define and test it in a proposal before implementation. |
| Agent notification | Could mean IPC event, Foundation event, macOS notification, TTS, or deferred in-app history. | Use the qualified notification terms in Canonical Terms. |

## Context Boundaries

- **Workspace organization** owns Project and Workspace identity, membership, ordering, Panel lifecycle, and selection state.
- **Worktree management** owns repository validation, branch operations, Managed Worktree creation/removal, managed storage, and orphan cleanup; it does not own Workspace Item Operations or Git Mutations.
- **Terminal runtime** owns Ghostty resources and shell state; Workspace organization references terminal runtime through Terminal Panels and IDs.
- **Files and Changes** owns Workspace Item Operations and Git Mutations, may read Workspace context, must resolve I/O roots explicitly, and publishes inspectable content through Workspace tab APIs.
- **User interface** owns presentation and transient interaction state, not repository, worktree, Workspace, or session truth.
- **Session persistence** owns serialized durable state and reconciliation; it must exclude live process, socket, Git status, and Agent status state.
- Future integration proposals must keep the Companion CLI transport-only, the Socket Server app-owned, and authoritative domain state in the Argus Application.
- Cross-context references use stable IDs and explicit service APIs; views must not infer identity from labels or paths.
