# Argus UI design principles

## Status

This document is the target UI behavior contract for Argus. It is derived from
the application spec and recent workspace, Files, Changes, diff, and tab work.
Recent code supplies evidence for these rules, but not every existing view is
fully compliant.

The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" are normative.
The application spec remains authoritative for product behavior. This document
governs how that behavior is presented and how users interact with it. If the
two conflict, resolve the conflict in the spec and this document rather than
adding a local exception.

New UI and materially changed UI MUST follow this contract. Existing code may
not yet satisfy every rule; that is implementation debt, not precedent for
another exception.

## Product posture

Argus is a dense, native macOS work tool. It SHOULD feel familiar to users of
terminal applications, editors, and source-control clients. The interface
exists to keep work moving, not to call attention to itself.

Three ideas take priority:

1. Keep work in its workspace.
2. Make every interaction legible before the user clicks.
3. Preserve context and layout while state changes.

Use system typography, SF Symbols, native controls, standard keyboard behavior,
and macOS materials unless a custom control materially improves the workspace.
Custom chrome SHOULD still behave like a macOS control.

## Surface model

Choose a surface based on the user's task, not implementation convenience.

| Surface | Purpose | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Center workspace tab | Content the user reads, operates on, or returns to | Terminal, browser, file, diff, blame |
| Left sidebar | Project and workspace navigation | Projects, workspaces, active workspace |
| Right sidebar | Contextual navigation, status, and compact actions | Files, Changes, git operations |
| Native Settings | Global application configuration | General, Appearance, Terminal, Files & Changes, Browser |
| Sheet | Short, bounded workflow requiring completion or cancellation | Create, rename, adopt |
| Alert | Confirmation or blocking failure requiring a decision | Delete, discard, remove worktree |
| Context menu | Secondary operations on a resource | Open, copy, rename, delete |

Argus is a single-window application. Inspectable content MUST NOT open an
additional independent `NSWindow`, `NSPanel`, or utility window. Attached
sheets, alerts, menus, and popovers remain valid for the transient workflows in
the table above. An additional content window is allowed only if the application
spec explicitly introduces a multi-window workflow.

Native Settings is application configuration, not inspectable content. It MAY
use the standard macOS Settings surface and MUST NOT be presented as a Workspace
tab.

## Settings controls

Settings MUST use native `Form`, `Picker`, `Toggle`, and `Stepper` patterns
where those controls express the setting. Settings controls MUST retain native
keyboard and accessibility behavior rather than recreating form controls as
custom chrome.

Files & Changes Settings MUST put common Files preferences first and group
repository presentation under a labeled Changes section. Supporting text MUST
stay visually attached to the setting it explains instead of occupying
detached form rows.

Appearance and density settings MUST preserve the opaque application shell and
its black focused / dark-grey unfocused background treatment. They MUST NOT
reduce required hit targets, divider drag targets, or other accessibility
geometry below this contract's minimums.

## Keep content in workspace tabs

Files, diffs, blame output, browser pages, and similar content MUST open in the
center column as tabs in the workspace that initiated the action.

Content tabs MUST use the normal workspace tab lifecycle:

- Insert a new tab immediately after the active top-level tab and select it.
- Use the shared tab bar for selection, reordering, and closing.
- Use the normal close command and adjacent-tab selection behavior.
- Keep content-specific controls inside the tab content header.
- Do not add a second close button inside the content view.

Opening a resource that is already open in the same workspace SHOULD select the
existing tab rather than create a duplicate. Mutable previews, such as diffs and
blame, SHOULD refresh the existing tab in place. Identity SHOULD include
workspace, repository root, content kind, and resource path. Different content
kinds, such as diff and blame for one file, remain distinct tabs.

Tab reuse is workspace-scoped. The same resource MAY be open in separate
workspaces because each workspace carries independent task context.

If loading finishes after the user has switched workspaces, the result MUST
remain attached to the workspace that initiated it. Completion MUST NOT switch
the selected workspace, raise another window, or steal keyboard focus. If the
originating workspace no longer exists, discard the result.

Sidebars remain available while a content tab is open. Opening content MUST NOT
replace or hide the navigator that opened it.

Persistence for every panel type MUST follow the application spec. Adding a new
content type requires an explicit persistence decision and corresponding tests.

## Tabs and split panes

A top-level tab MAY own a split tree of terminal panes. The tab remains the unit
shown, reordered, and closed in the tab bar; a pane remains the unit focused for
keyboard input.

- A nonempty Workspace MUST have exactly one active top-level tab and one pane within its split tree. An Empty Workspace has neither.
- Split commands operate on the focused terminal pane and MUST NOT create
  another top-level tab.
- A new split SHOULD inherit the focused pane's working directory and become
  focused.
- Closing a focused pane in a multi-pane tab MUST close only that pane, collapse
  the remaining layout, and focus a surviving pane.
- Closing the only pane MUST use the normal top-level tab lifecycle.
- Closing a Terminal Pane or Terminal Tab that still has a running process MUST
  confirm that the process will be terminated. Cancel MUST leave that Pane or
  Tab active and unchanged.
- Closing the last terminal top-level tab MUST confirm Workspace closure when
  the keep-open preference is disabled. That confirmation MUST include any
  running-process consequence instead of presenting a second dialog. The safe
  cancel action MUST leave that Terminal Panel active and unchanged. When the
  preference is enabled, closing that tab removes its complete split tree and
  leaves an Empty Workspace after any required running-process confirmation.
- Closing a Workspace or quitting the application MUST confirm when any
  affected Terminal Surface still has a running process. Workspace confirmation
  MUST combine that warning with any worktree-deletion choice. Application-quit
  confirmation MUST name each affected Workspace and its Named Project or
  Standalone Workspace directory context.
- Reordering a top-level tab MUST move its complete split tree.
- Split dividers MUST provide an enlarged drag target and resize cursor.

File, diff, blame, and browser content SHOULD open as top-level tabs unless the
application spec defines split support for that content type.

## Make interactions legible

Every enabled custom clickable surface MUST provide all of these affordances:

- A hit area matching the visible row or control, normally via
  `contentShape(Rectangle())`.
- Visible hover feedback.
- A pointing-hand cursor through `.cursor(.pointingHand)` or a shared equivalent.
- A tooltip naming the action when the visible content does not name it.
- An accessible label when the visible content does not name the action.

This rule applies to rows, tabs, disclosure controls, icon buttons, segmented
chrome controls, and hover-revealed actions. Every enabled icon-only control MUST
provide the full set of affordances above, whether implemented as a SwiftUI
`Button`, an AppKit control, or a custom clickable surface. Icon-only standard
buttons are not exempt. Native text fields, pickers, menus, and standard buttons
whose visible text names the action MAY retain native cursor behavior. Disabled
controls MUST look disabled, reject input, and MUST NOT show a pointing-hand
cursor.

Use specialized cursors where the operation has a stronger established
meaning:

- Resize cursors for draggable dividers and resize handles.
- I-beam cursors for selectable or editable text.
- Ghostty-provided cursor state inside terminal surfaces.
- Drag or grab cursors where direct manipulation requires them.

Do not make users infer clickability from an icon alone. Icon-only controls MUST
have a tooltip and accessibility label. Use SF Symbols with consistent weight
and scale throughout application chrome.

## Hover, selection, and progressive disclosure

Hover is transient. Selection and active state are persistent. Their treatments
MUST be visually distinct, and selected or active state MUST remain stronger
than hover.

Use these treatments consistently:

- Clickable rows receive a subtle full-row hover fill.
- Compact icon actions receive a local rounded hover fill.
- Active tabs and selected rows retain a visible fill when the pointer leaves.
- Hover MUST NOT obscure the selected state.

Secondary actions MAY appear on hover to keep dense lists readable. Hover
disclosure MUST NOT move labels, resize rows, or change neighboring layout.
Reserve the action area and crossfade or overlay the alternate content. Git file
rows, where diff statistics give way to actions in the same trailing region,
are the reference pattern.

Controls hidden by hover state MUST also be removed from hit testing and the
accessibility tree. Hover MUST NOT be the only way to perform an operation.
Provide the same operation through keyboard focus, an accessibility action, a
context menu, or another persistent control.

## Hit areas and density

Argus favors compact desktop density, but visible size and hit size are
different concerns.

- A clickable row MUST use the full available row width as its hit area.
- Compact icon actions SHOULD provide at least a 20 by 20 point hit area.
- A one-point divider MUST provide an invisible drag target at least 6 points
  wide. The current 12-point divider target is preferred.
- Increasing hit area MUST NOT add visible padding that breaks established row
  density.

Application chrome SHOULD use plain button styling with explicit hover and
selection treatment. Forms and sheets SHOULD use native fields, segmented
pickers, default actions, and cancel actions rather than recreating them.

## Stable layout and restrained motion

Interaction feedback MUST NOT cause content to jump. Reserve space for loading
indicators, badges, hover actions, and controls whose state changes frequently.

Refreshes SHOULD keep already loaded content visible. Show a compact progress
indicator in reserved chrome while new data loads. Replace the whole view with a
loading state only when no useful content is available yet or when the context
has changed completely.

Motion communicates state only. Use short transitions, typically around 150 to
250 milliseconds, for disclosure, selection, and appearance changes. Avoid
decorative motion, bounce, and page-load choreography. Resizing and direct
manipulation MUST track the pointer without animation.

## Sidebar hierarchy

Sidebars are navigators, not alternate content areas. They SHOULD stay compact,
use full-width rows, and put directories before files at each tree level.
Disclosure state belongs to the tree row; opening content belongs to a tab.

Collection headers MUST preserve the user's entered casing, use semibold primary
text stronger than muted Project headings, and show a disclosure chevron with a
subtle trailing horizontal rule. They MUST NOT show a Project count, icon, color
marker, vertical rail, or persistent card/background. A transient full-width
hover/focus treatment remains appropriate. The rule MUST give way before the
name truncates and disappear below 160 points. Use the application's text and
density metrics, with more space before the header than below it.

With Collections present, Named Project content MUST have one 8-point leading
inset at normal widths and no additional inset below 160 points. This inset MUST
remain inside full-width Workspace selection fills and hit regions. It MUST NOT
change Stack gutter/connector geometry, icon/process slots, or introduce
recursive indentation. Collection disclosure MUST only expand/collapse. A
collapsed Collection MUST retain readable Selected Workspace context as
Project / Workspace and undimmed Turn Completion Attention without acknowledging
it. Explicit selection MUST reveal every ancestor, including same-ID reselection.

In the left sidebar, Stack Groups MUST use shallow collapsible headers and
fixed-inset Workspace rows rather than recursively nesting Workspaces. A
connector points from an actual recorded parent to its dependent and MUST use
measured row geometry. Forks MUST use distinct connector lanes rather than
connecting adjacent sibling rows as a chain, while member text keeps a fixed
inset within each group. Status icons and process badges retain their own
meanings; missing-Workspace parent references appear once, are nonselectable,
and receive no shortcut. Unknown or conflicted parents MUST be described
honestly, and help/accessibility MUST include all recorded direct dependents.
Disclosure never selects content or acknowledges Turn Completion Attention.

At narrow sidebar widths, decorative spacing and icons MAY give way to a
compact layout. Discovery and Add actions MAY share a reserved control area
when their context-menu alternatives remain available. Process badges MAY sit
below labels, but their space MUST remain stable when a count becomes zero.
Required hit targets, status information, full-row selection, and relationship
help MUST remain available at the supported minimum width.

Every Workspace row MUST reserve one fixed 20 by 20 point leading icon slot at
all sidebar widths, including rows that are not eligible for Pull Request
Status. Workspace icon precedence MUST be Turn Completion Attention → non-idle
Agent Status (running, needs input, error) → Pull Request Status → idle Agent
Status → Workspace-type icon. Apply this precedence to the newest effective
Agent Status Entry without changing aggregation; Top-level Tab icon precedence
is unchanged.

Worktree Workspace Pull Request Status MUST use this shared leading slot:

- Keep the title and branch lines and let them use the available text width.
  Rows MUST NOT reserve a trailing Pull Request slot or show Pull Request numbers.
  Pull Request numbers belong only in the popover, help, and accessibility text
  and MUST NOT use localized digit grouping. Branches MUST continue to truncate
  in the middle.
- Keep the running-process count on the title line outside compact layouts.
  Compact layouts MUST retain their separate stable process-count row. Stack
  Group connectors and gutters MUST retain their geometry, separate from the
  shared leading slot.
- The Command-held shortcut digit MUST take visual priority. When it covers
  Pull Request Status, the hidden icon control MUST reject hit testing and be
  removed from the accessibility tree.
- Selection and Pull Request Status MUST be sibling controls, never nested
  buttons. Retain the row selection hit area, reordering, and context menu. The
  visible icon MUST independently open the existing popover and provide hover
  feedback, a pointing-hand cursor, help, keyboard activation, and an
  accessibility value containing the full status even at narrow widths.
- Pull Request Status inspection MUST NOT change the Selected Workspace, Active
  Tab, Focused Pane, or Right-sidebar View. Escape MUST dismiss the popover and
  return focus to its invoking icon if still visible, otherwise to the row.
  Context menus MUST retain Show/Refresh actions when Turn Completion Attention
  or non-idle Agent Status hides the icon, and after confirmed no match or
  failure. A hidden Pull Request Status control MUST be non-interactive and
  accessibility-hidden.
- The native popover MUST use foreground and material appearances that match the
  main Workspace window. It MUST show the Pull Request number, title, status,
  refresh information, and actions without repeating the repository, head branch,
  or base branch.
- Open Pull Request MUST use the default system browser without mutating
  Workspace, Top-level Tab, or Pane state or changing the Right-sidebar View.
  This explicit external navigation does not change the in-Workspace surface
  rules for other inspectable content.
- Automatic Pull Request refresh MUST be quiet: no sidebar or popover progress
  indicator, and no temporary loading icon or refreshing help text. Keep the
  last-known status and errors; normal freshness and identity validation still
  apply. With no status or error, including confirmed no match, use idle Agent
  Status or the Workspace-type icon subject to the shared precedence. Not-checked
  and unavailable states MUST remain distinguishable through help and the popover.
- Clicking Refresh in the popover MUST show progress beside that action while
  its Workspace refresh is pending or running, even with cached status. Progress
  MUST stop on completion, failure, suspension, a quota/rate-limit pause, state
  removal, or dismissal. Automatic work MUST NOT activate or reactivate it.
  Dismissal MUST reset only the popover's progress presentation, not cancel shared
  refresh work. Progress MUST NOT change selection or focus.
- A host quota/rate-limit pause MUST retain last-known content, explain the
  resume time, and disable manual Refresh until the deadline. Paused work MUST
  NOT display an indefinite loading indicator.
- For a known Pull Request, the single status icon MUST use the highest-priority
  applicable signal: stale (error-based) → failed checks → changes requested →
  pending checks → unavailable → approval; otherwise, use lifecycle.
  Merged/closed MUST suppress every signal except stale. The stale signal MUST
  fire only when a non-nil refresh error is present; age-only staleness (elapsed
  time without an error) MUST retain the last-known check, review, or lifecycle
  icon rather than replacing it with an orange warning triangle. Both kinds of
  staleness MUST retain stale or cached detail in help and the popover, with an
  orange warning style for error-based and a neutral style for age-only. Use
  semantic icons and text, not color alone or pulsing.

The Changes View MUST render the ordered typed Change Sections in the active
Git Status Snapshot. With both Changes View settings disabled, it MUST preserve
the Staged, Unstaged, and Untracked sections and their existing layout. When
combination is enabled, it MUST render one Uncommitted section; when Against
Base is enabled, it MUST append the read-only Against Base section after all
Working Changes sections. Working sections MUST always precede Against Base.

Each available section shows its entry count and exposes only operations valid
for its typed kind. Empty available sections remain visible and collapsible. An
unavailable Against Base section remains visible while enabled, shows a concise
branch/error message, and exposes no rows or operations. Section actions,
expansion, directory IDs, row IDs, counts, and accessibility values MUST be
driven by typed section and Git File Change data rather than localized titles.

The branch summary bar SHOULD show branch identity plus aggregate file,
addition, deletion, and upstream information in one compact row. The branch
name leads, aggregate counts follow when present, and upstream with ahead/behind
counts trails at a stable anchor. Branch and upstream references truncate
independently as space narrows; the full values and sync state remain available
in help text. Aggregate counts appear only when at least one active comparison
context has an entry. Its
total and the Changes badge MUST use active section entries, including entries
that occur in both Working Changes and Against Base as separate comparison
contexts.

Long directory chains MAY be compacted when the intermediate directories add no
choice. Compaction MUST preserve the full path in help and accessibility text.
Expansion controls MUST state whether they expand or collapse and whether they
affect one directory, one section, or all sections.

Large trees MUST remain bounded according to the application spec or service
limit. When rows are omitted, the sidebar MUST disclose that the result is
truncated and show the total count when known. The Changes View MUST apply the
global 500-entry cap in visible section order while retaining uncapped section
counts and Section Operation scope. Its truncation copy MUST describe omitted
change entries rather than implying that every entry is a unique file.

Changing either Changes View setting is a presentation refresh, not navigation.
It MUST preserve the Selected Workspace, Active Tab, Focused Pane, Right
Sidebar selection, existing Git Preview Tabs, scroll position, and expansion
state. Expand/collapse-all MUST affect only currently present, available
sections, and expansion state MUST remain independent for each typed section
kind when settings are toggled.

## Selection, activation, and focus

Selection and activation are separate where users may act on a resource before
opening it. File trees are the reference behavior: a single click selects, a
double click or explicit Open action opens a file tab, and a directory click
selects and toggles disclosure.

Selecting a workspace tab MUST run the shared focus lifecycle. Terminal tabs
MUST restore terminal focus. Background tabs and asynchronous work MUST NOT
steal first responder status.

The main window MUST distinguish keyboard/key-window focus from application
activation through its background appearance, without a titlebar focus strip
or perimeter outline. This cue MUST remain available with both sidebars hidden.
Inactive headers and toolbar controls SHOULD soften, while the Selected
Workspace and Active Tab MUST remain identifiable.
The shell, default Terminal backgrounds, and app-owned document backgrounds MUST
be dark grey while the window is unfocused and return to their focused colors
when it becomes key. Change the actual backgrounds, not foreground content;
images, web-page styling, and semantic diff highlights retain their own colors.
Panel content, Agent Status, and Turn Completion Attention MUST NOT be dimmed.
Focus appearance MUST NOT move content, intercept input, or change selection.
Increased Contrast MUST preserve ordinary chrome opacity. Focus feedback MUST
NOT rely on a hue change alone.

Common actions MUST have standard menu commands and keyboard shortcuts. This
includes creating a workspace or tab, closing the active pane or tab, splitting
a terminal, toggling sidebars, and selecting numbered workspaces. Custom
gesture-backed rows MUST expose equivalent button or accessibility semantics so
keyboard and VoiceOver users can activate them.

Drag-and-drop reordering SHOULD preserve the same selection and focus state as
click-based reordering. Reordering MUST NOT create or destroy resources.

## Destructive actions

Any action that can permanently remove user data, uncommitted work, a worktree,
a project, or a running terminal process MUST require explicit confirmation.
This applies to both one-item and bulk operations.

Confirmation UI MUST:

- Name the operation and affected resource.
- State the irreversible effect in plain language.
- Show the accurate affected count for bulk actions.
- Provide a safe Cancel action.
- Mark the destructive action with the native destructive role where available.

Non-destructive, reversible source-control actions such as stage and unstage
SHOULD execute directly and refresh status afterward.

Destructive actions SHOULD NOT dominate idle UI. They belong in hover actions,
context menus, or explicit confirmation flows, with semantic color used for the
decision rather than decoration.

## Loading, empty, error, and disabled states

Every asynchronous surface MUST define initial loading, refresh, empty, error,
and loaded states.

- Initial loading uses a compact progress indicator and a short, specific label.
- Refresh keeps existing content visible and uses reserved indicator space.
- Controls that would start a duplicate operation MUST be disabled while that
  operation is running.
- Empty states state what is empty and, when useful, give the next available
  action.
- An Empty Workspace keeps the Center Content Area Titlebar, Top-level Tab bar,
  and Right Sidebar available, and offers a native “New Terminal Tab” action
  in the content region. Rendering the state MUST NOT create a placeholder
  Panel or change Workspace selection.
- Error states include a concise title, useful detail, and a recovery action
  when recovery is possible.
- Bounded or truncated data sets disclose the limit and the total when known.

State changes MUST preserve scroll position, selection, expansion, and focus
unless the underlying workspace or resource changed. A refresh is not a
navigation event.

## Visual language

The application shell uses an opaque background across the native window,
sidebars, Center Content Area Titlebar, and Top-level Tab bar: black while key,
dark grey (`#1A1A1A`) otherwise. Terminal default backgrounds follow the same
treatment while retaining other active Ghostty configuration and theme colors.
App-owned document backgrounds also respond to window focus; document foreground
colors remain unchanged. Use shared `ChromeColors` values rather than local fixed
colors. Separators use subtle adaptive one-point lines, and sidebars MUST NOT
use translucent materials.

Established geometry is the default:

- 44-point primary sidebar and titlebar headers.
- 30-point tab bars, root bars, and content subheaders.
- Single-row branch summary bars: branch identity leads, aggregate and upstream
  metadata share the row at a smaller size, with a minimum height of 30 points.
- Compact 10 to 14 point system type in chrome and trees.
- Monospaced type for paths, branches, counts, code, and terminal-oriented data.

Use semantic color for selection, status, additions, deletions, warning, error,
and success. Do not use color as the only signal. Pair it with text, an icon, or
an accessibility value.

Git file status MUST use the status-specific icon and color required by the
application spec. Its accessibility value MUST also name the status. A generic
colored dot is not sufficient.

Long paths and branch names SHOULD truncate in the middle. Human-readable names
SHOULD truncate at the end. Keep information hierarchy clear without adding
decorative cards, shadows, gradients, or extra containers.

## Content readability

File, diff, and blame content SHOULD use monospaced type, remain selectable, and
follow the active light or dark appearance. Loading and rendering failures MUST
stay inside the originating content tab rather than opening another window.

Diff-specific view controls belong in the content header. Split and unified
layout SHOULD use compact native controls. Their state is local to the content
tab unless the product explicitly defines a workspace-wide preference. Long
diff lines scroll horizontally. Unsupported, binary, oversized, or failed
previews MUST show a recoverable in-tab message rather than blank content.

## Accessibility and help

Pointer polish is not a substitute for accessible interaction.

- Icon-only controls MUST have `.help` text and an accessibility label.
- Selection, expansion, disabled state, and operation status MUST be exposed to
  assistive technology.
- Status MUST NOT rely on color alone.
- Hover-revealed controls MUST have a non-hover path.
- Hidden controls MUST be both non-interactive and accessibility-hidden.
- Text content such as files, diffs, and blame output SHOULD remain selectable.
- Focus order SHOULD follow visual order and remain stable across refreshes.

## Copy and labels

Labels SHOULD describe the object or result directly. Action labels use a verb
and object when space permits, such as "Refresh changes", "Delete file", or
"New workspace". Avoid generic labels such as "OK" when the button can name the
action.

Tooltips use sentence-style action names. Confirmation copy names the affected
resource and consequence. Errors report what failed and preserve the underlying
error detail when it helps recovery.

## Enforcement

UI contract tests SHOULD protect behavior that can regress without a compiler
error. At minimum, tests for a new interaction pattern MUST cover applicable
items from this list:

- Correct surface placement, especially tab rather than window presentation.
- Resource identity, tab reuse, and refresh-in-place behavior.
- Hover feedback, pointing-hand cursor, full hit area, and stable geometry.
- Selection precedence over hover.
- Hidden-control hit testing and accessibility behavior.
- Destructive confirmation and bulk-operation scope.
- Workspace ownership and focus behavior for asynchronous completion.

Source-contract tests are useful for wiring, but they do not replace a manual
check of pointer, keyboard, VoiceOver, light appearance, and dark appearance.

When a feature needs a behavior that contradicts this document, update this
contract in the same change and explain why the exception should become a new
project-wide rule.
