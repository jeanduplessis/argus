# Developing Argus

## Organizing Projects

Choose **New Collection…** from the Projects plus menu or File menu. Use a
Project's context menu to move it into a Collection or back to **No Collection**.
The same menus provide move-up/down actions. Choose **New Project…** from a
Collection's context menu to create a Named Project directly in that Collection;
its Main-checkout Workspace is selected and the Collection is revealed.
Top-level and File-menu **New Project…** actions create ungrouped Named Projects.
Collection menus also offer rename and removal. Removing a Collection keeps its
Projects and all open work intact.

Drag Project headers to reorder or move whole Project blocks. Drop on a
Collection header to append, or on the top Projects header to return a Project
to Other Projects. Drop above or below the midpoint of another Project header
to insert before or after it. Collection headers can be reordered the same way.
Disclosure does not change Workspace shortcuts; selecting a hidden Workspace
reveals all of its ancestors.

## Requirements

Argus targets macOS 26 and Swift 6. The Xcode project is generated from `project.yml` for Xcode 26.

Required tools:

- Xcode 26 or later;
- Xcode command-line tools;
- XcodeGen;
- SwiftLint;
- the vendored `Frameworks/GhosttyKit.xcframework`.

Swift 6 toolchains include `swift-format`. Install the other command-line tools with:

```sh
brew install xcodegen swiftlint
```

The GitHub CLI is optional for Pull Request intake and read-only Pull Request
Status in Named Project Worktree Workspaces. Argus uses the active `gh`
authentication context and never stores GitHub credentials. Missing CLI or
authentication does not block local work; Argus never installs or logs in for you.

Install and authenticate it with:

```sh
brew install gh
gh auth login
```

For bare-number intake or Pull Request Status, run `gh repo set-default <remote>`
from the Project Repository Root if repository selection is ambiguous or
unavailable. The default repository must match a Project fetch remote. For
GitHub Enterprise, authenticate with `gh auth login --hostname <host>`.

Settings > Files & Changes > **Show Pull Request status** defaults to on. It
contacts GitHub while the application is active and the main window is visible
and not minimized; turning it off cancels work and clears runtime status.
After CLI, authentication, or repository setup changes, use **Refresh Pull
Request Status** in the Workspace context menu or **Refresh** in its Pull Request
Status popover to bypass ordinary caches, subject to host quota/rate-limit pauses.
Automatic refresh is quiet; **Refresh** shows progress only inside the popover
that started it.
The shared leading Pull Request Status icon opens the popover without selecting
its Workspace. **Show Pull Request Status** and **Refresh Pull Request Status**
remain in the Workspace context menu when the icon is hidden or after no match
or failure; rows have no trailing Pull Request slot or Pull Request-number text.
Detailed statuses are batched through `gh api graphql`; a known Selected
Workspace Pull Request refreshes every minute, with background discovery every
ten minutes. Quota pauses show a resume time and disable manual refresh too;
toggling the setting does not bypass the pause. **Refresh changes** remains
local-Git-only. **Open Pull Request** uses the default system browser without
mutating Workspace, Top-level Tab, or Pane state or changing the Right-sidebar
View.

## Local Stack grouping

Argus groups open Workspaces from locally recorded parent relationships in:

- `branch.<branch>.base` Git configuration;
- Graphite `refs/branch-metadata/<branch>` JSON objects with `parentBranchName`;
- the official [`github/gh-stack`](https://github.com/github/gh-stack)
  extension's schema-v1 `<git-dir>/gh-stack` files.

The same reader supplies Against Base. A valid explicit config value overrides
tool metadata; matching tool parents coalesce, and conflicting parents are
reported rather than guessed. A group requires at least two open Workspaces
in one connected recorded-parent component. Forks retain their shared parent,
while independent branches merely based on the unparented Project main branch
remain separate. Argus never initializes, repairs, restacks, or merges Stacks.

The gh-stack format was audited against v0.1.0 and revision
`2bd699a544a09cb5c45a013d03416e0894b0454e`. Linked worktrees have separate
tracking files, so Argus inspects common and linked administration and binds
verified current checkouts. It does not invoke `gh stack view`, which can
contact GitHub and rewrite tracking even with `--json`. Unknown future schemas
produce diagnostics rather than a guessed interpretation.

The Project context menu provides **Refresh Stacks**. Missing metadata leaves
ordinary rows unchanged; malformed or conflicting sources do not erase valid
unrelated relationships. A current-branch conflict makes only Against Base
unavailable, preserving Working Changes. Repository/common and linked metadata
changes refresh automatically, including configuration and packed Graphite
refs; configuration outside those watched roots is reread on explicit or other
refresh. Metadata files and combined command output are bounded to 1 MiB, and
branch/parent names to 4096 UTF-8 bytes.

With a separate Git directory, a linked checkout may not have enough Git
registration data to recover the physical main checkout. Argus leaves that
unknown binding unbound rather than mistaking metadata storage for a Workspace;
starting from the actual Project Repository Root provides the verified binding.
See [ADR 0009](adrs/0009-share-tool-agnostic-recorded-parents.md).

## Generate the Xcode project

`project.yml` is the source of truth for Xcode project configuration.

```sh
./scripts/build.sh generate
```

The build script generates `Argus.xcodeproj` automatically if it is missing.

## Build commands

Build the Debug application and CLI scaffold:

```sh
./scripts/build.sh build
```

Build and launch:

```sh
./scripts/build.sh run
```

Build a Release configuration:

```sh
./scripts/build.sh build --release
```

Install a local build in `/Applications` and launch it:

```sh
./scripts/build.sh install --release
```

Other supported commands:

```sh
./scripts/build.sh cli
./scripts/build.sh clean
```

Pass `--no-cli` to omit the CLI scaffold or `--no-open` to build or install without launching Argus.

Build products are written under `.build/Build/Products/<configuration>/`. Within the built application, the CLI is bundled at `Argus.app/Contents/Resources/bin/argus`. It currently exposes version and help output only; socket-backed commands are future work.

## Tests and formatting

Run the complete app and CLI validation suite:

```sh
./scripts/test.sh
```

The script runs formatting checks and SwiftLint, executes the macOS `ArgusTests` target, builds the CLI, and verifies its version and help output.

The existing Kilo/Pi behavioral harness tests require Node in the Xcode test-host
PATH. For shell-managed Node installations, forward that PATH explicitly with
`TEST_RUNNER_PATH="$PATH" ./scripts/test.sh`.

Run linting by itself:

```sh
./scripts/lint.sh
```

Format Swift sources:

```sh
./scripts/format.sh
```

Set `SWIFT_FORMAT_BIN` or `SWIFTLINT_BIN` when the executables are outside the active Swift toolchain and standard Homebrew paths.

Tests are grouped by product domain:

- `WorkspaceTests`: window, sidebar, tab, Panel, Browser, Settings, and Agent Status behavior;
- `WorktreeTests`: Projects, repositories, branches, and worktrees;
- `SessionTests`: Session Snapshot and restore behavior;
- `GitStatusTests`: status parsing, Files and Changes behavior, operations, and previews;
- `TestSupport`: shared native test helpers.

Prefer behavioral tests through `@testable import Argus`. Source-contract tests are reserved for SwiftUI and AppKit wiring that cannot be observed through a stable boundary without a full UI test.

Automatic Pull Request Status networking is disabled for app instances with
`XCTestConfigurationFilePath`, `ARGUS_UNDER_TEST=1`, or
`ARGUS_DISABLE_SESSION_RESTORE=1`. Status tests inject provider/local-input
fixtures and scheduling rather than relying on live GitHub access.

## Native diff rendering

Argus renders structured diffs with the native `SwiftDiffs` package. Git Preview
Tabs keep Split and Unified layout controls; long lines scroll horizontally.
Blame previews remain ANSI text. See
`docs/adrs/0002-render-structured-diffs-with-native-swift-diffs.md` for ownership
and runtime boundaries.

## GhosttyKit

Normal builds use the vendored `Frameworks/GhosttyKit.xcframework`. Rebuilding the framework is a maintainer task and is separate from the normal application workflow. See `Frameworks/README.md` and `scripts/build-ghosttykit.sh` before changing it.

## Agent integrations

Argus installs integrations only when enabled from Settings. Kilo owns its
managed JSON/JSONC declaration and completion extension. Pi owns
`extensions/argus-agent-status.js` under the effective `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`
(or `~/.pi/agent` when the variable is unset). Existing files owned by another
program are never replaced or removed.

Restart Kilo sessions after changing the Kilo integration. Restart Pi or use
`/reload` after changing the Pi integration. Both integrations send requests to
the app-owned `~/.argus/argus.sock` endpoint. The socket accepts
`agent.turnCompleted`, `agent.statusChanged`, and `agent.statusCleared`; it is
not a Companion CLI command transport.

After updating Argus, enable the Pi integration again in Settings to install
its bundled extension, then restart Pi or use `/reload`. Reloading alone does
not copy the updated extension from Argus.

The Pi extension ignores processes marked with `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD=1`. When
`pi-subagents` advertises its public fleet status API, a main agent that yields
with delegated work still active stays running in Argus and produces no
completion sound or Turn Completion Attention. Completion is reported at the
next successful main-agent settlement with no active delegated work. An
advertised status API that is unsupported or fails suppresses completion;
plain Pi sessions need no subagent package.

Run the Pi lifecycle and socket transport regression tests without launching
Argus or making model calls:

```sh
node Tests/PiIntegrationTests/pi-plugin-events.mjs
```

## Local state

Argus writes user state outside the repository:

- Session Snapshot: `~/Library/Application Support/Argus/session.json`
- Managed Worktrees: `~/.argus/worktrees/<project-uuid>/<branch-slug>/`
- App-owned socket: `~/.argus/argus.sock`

Set `ARGUS_DISABLE_SESSION_RESTORE=1` to launch without restoring the previous Session Snapshot.

## Worktree Setup

Use a Named Project's **Worktree Setup…** context action to save an optional local
command. Blank disables it. Argus runs the exact command through non-login,
noninteractive `/bin/sh -c` in every newly created worktree, including Stack and
fork Pull Request worktrees. Save grants execution with your user permissions:
only enable commands and repositories you trust. Argus does not discover setup
configuration or copy ignored files. Existing/reused, adopted, Main-checkout, and
restored Workspaces do not run setup automatically.

The initial Terminal Tab remains. The runtime **Worktree Setup** tab shows the
command, directory, live output (last 1 MiB), and result. **Stop** terminates the
owned ordinary process group. **Run Setup Again** uses the current Project command
after validating ownership. The Workspace context menu can reopen the log or run
setup explicitly. Closing a stopped tab retains its last bounded log/result until
the Workspace closes or Argus exits; reopening does not rerun it. Explicit retry
replaces prior output. Failures keep the Workspace. Logs are not saved or sent to
system logs; the Project command is stored locally in the Session Snapshot.

The inherited environment includes installed `/opt/homebrew/bin` and
`/usr/local/bin` paths but excludes Argus socket/Workspace/Surface identity.
Stdin is EOF; there is no terminal prompt support, login-shell startup, or service
supervisor. Commands time out after one hour. Do not start detached background
services: process-group cleanup is not containment of deliberately daemonized
code. Closing active setup requires confirmation and waits for cleanup before
worktree deletion. Failed cleanup retains the owned group and blocks closure;
Stop can retry verification without signaling a recycled process-group ID.

Multiple Workspaces can reference one worktree. Deletion is refused if setup is
pending, running, or awaiting cleanup in another Workspace outside the close
scope. Stop setup in the Workspace named by the error, then retry deletion.
This denial does not stop either Workspace's task or remove files. Close without
deletion still stops only its target. Project removal checks all captured child
worktree roots before stopping any child setup. While deletion or its setup
cleanup is in progress, those canonical roots cannot start setup from any
Workspace, including a newly attached duplicate. Reservations release on failure
and after deletion/state removal. Adoption is refused while its Project is closing
or application-wide setup cleanup is in progress.

Focused tests are `WorktreeSetupRunnerTests`, `WorktreeSetupManagerTests`, and
`WorktreeSetupLifecycleTests`; Pull Request integration has a setup-specific
fixture in `PullRequestWorkspaceTests`. Runner tests execute only synthetic local
commands in disposable directories. Manager tests inject a runner and use local
Git fixtures, never repository-provided setup commands or live provider access.
See ADR 0012 for runtime and ownership trade-offs.
