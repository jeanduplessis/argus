# Developing Argus

## Organizing Projects

Choose **New Collection…** from the Projects plus menu or File menu. Use a
Project's context menu to move it into a Collection or back to **No Collection**.
The same menus provide move-up/down actions; Collection menus also offer rename
and removal. Removing a Collection keeps its Projects and all open work intact.

Drag Project headers to reorder or move whole Project blocks. Drop on a
Collection header to append, or on the top Projects header to return a Project
to Other Projects. Drop above or below the midpoint of another Project header
to insert before or after it. Collection headers can be reordered the same way.
Disclosure does not change Workspace shortcuts; selecting a hidden Workspace
reveals all of its ancestors.

## Requirements

Argus targets macOS 26 and Swift 6. The Xcode project is generated from `project.yml` for Xcode 26.

Required tools:

- Xcode 26 or later;
- Xcode command-line tools;
- XcodeGen;
- SwiftLint;
- the vendored `Frameworks/GhosttyKit.xcframework`.

Swift 6 toolchains include `swift-format`. Install the other command-line tools with:

```sh
brew install xcodegen swiftlint
```

The GitHub CLI is optional for Pull Request intake and read-only Pull Request
Status in Named Project Worktree Workspaces. Argus uses the active `gh`
authentication context and never stores GitHub credentials. Missing CLI or
authentication does not block local work; Argus never installs or logs in for you.

Install and authenticate it with:

```sh
brew install gh
gh auth login
```

For bare-number intake or Pull Request Status, run `gh repo set-default <remote>`
from the Project Repository Root if repository selection is ambiguous or
unavailable. The default repository must match a Project fetch remote. For
GitHub Enterprise, authenticate with `gh auth login --hostname <host>`.

Settings > Files & Changes > **Show Pull Request status** defaults to on. It
contacts GitHub while the application is active and the main window is visible
and not minimized; turning it off cancels work and clears runtime status.
After CLI, authentication, or repository setup changes, use **Refresh Pull
Request Status** in the Workspace context menu or **Refresh** in its Pull Request
Status popover to bypass ordinary caches, subject to host quota/rate-limit pauses.
Automatic refresh is quiet; **Refresh** shows progress only inside the popover
that started it.
The shared leading Pull Request Status icon opens the popover without selecting
its Workspace. **Show Pull Request Status** and **Refresh Pull Request Status**
remain in the Workspace context menu when the icon is hidden or after no match
or failure; rows have no trailing Pull Request slot or Pull Request-number text.
Detailed statuses are batched through `gh api graphql`; a known Selected
Workspace Pull Request refreshes every minute, with background discovery every
ten minutes. Quota pauses show a resume time and disable manual refresh too;
toggling the setting does not bypass the pause. **Refresh changes** remains
local-Git-only. **Open Pull Request** uses the default system browser without
mutating Workspace, Top-level Tab, or Pane state or changing the Right-sidebar
View.

## Local Stack grouping

Argus groups open Workspaces from locally recorded parent relationships in:

- `branch.<branch>.base` Git configuration;
- Graphite `refs/branch-metadata/<branch>` JSON objects with `parentBranchName`;
- the official [`github/gh-stack`](https://github.com/github/gh-stack)
  extension's schema-v1 `<git-dir>/gh-stack` files.

The same reader supplies Against Base. A valid explicit config value overrides
tool metadata; matching tool parents coalesce, and conflicting parents are
reported rather than guessed. A group requires at least two open Workspaces
in one connected recorded-parent component. Forks retain their shared parent,
while independent branches merely based on the unparented Project main branch
remain separate. Argus never initializes, repairs, restacks, or merges Stacks.

The gh-stack format was audited against v0.1.0 and revision
`2bd699a544a09cb5c45a013d03416e0894b0454e`. Linked worktrees have separate
tracking files, so Argus inspects common and linked administration and binds
verified current checkouts. It does not invoke `gh stack view`, which can
contact GitHub and rewrite tracking even with `--json`. Unknown future schemas
produce diagnostics rather than a guessed interpretation.

The Project context menu provides **Refresh Stacks**. Missing metadata leaves
ordinary rows unchanged; malformed or conflicting sources do not erase valid
unrelated relationships. A current-branch conflict makes only Against Base
unavailable, preserving Working Changes. Repository/common and linked metadata
changes refresh automatically, including configuration and packed Graphite
refs; configuration outside those watched roots is reread on explicit or other
refresh. Metadata files and combined command output are bounded to 1 MiB, and
branch/parent names to 4096 UTF-8 bytes.

With a separate Git directory, a linked checkout may not have enough Git
registration data to recover the physical main checkout. Argus leaves that
unknown binding unbound rather than mistaking metadata storage for a Workspace;
starting from the actual Project Repository Root provides the verified binding.

## Generate the Xcode project

`project.yml` is the source of truth for Xcode project configuration.

```sh
./scripts/build.sh generate
```

The build script generates `Argus.xcodeproj` automatically if it is missing.

## Build commands

Build the Debug application and CLI scaffold:

```sh
./scripts/build.sh build
```

Build and launch:

```sh
./scripts/build.sh run
```

Build a Release configuration:

```sh
./scripts/build.sh build --release
```

Install a local build in `/Applications` and launch it:

```sh
./scripts/build.sh install --release
```

Other supported commands:

```sh
./scripts/build.sh cli
./scripts/build.sh clean
```

Pass `--no-cli` to omit the CLI scaffold or `--no-open` to build or install without launching Argus.

Build products are written under `.build/Build/Products/<configuration>/`. Within the built application, the CLI is bundled at `Argus.app/Contents/Resources/bin/argus`, and Argus puts that directory first on the `PATH` of every shell it spawns, so `argus` resolves by name in an Argus terminal.

## Tests and formatting

Run the complete app and CLI validation suite:

```sh
./scripts/test.sh
```

The script runs formatting checks and SwiftLint, executes the macOS `ArgusTests` target, builds the CLI, and verifies its version and help output.

The existing Kilo/Pi behavioral harness tests require Node in the Xcode test-host
PATH. For shell-managed Node installations, forward that PATH explicitly with
`TEST_RUNNER_PATH="$PATH" ./scripts/test.sh`.

Run linting by itself:

```sh
./scripts/lint.sh
```

Format Swift sources:

```sh
./scripts/format.sh
```

Set `SWIFT_FORMAT_BIN` or `SWIFTLINT_BIN` when the executables are outside the active Swift toolchain and standard Homebrew paths.

Tests are grouped by product domain:

- `WorkspaceTests`: window, sidebar, tab, Panel, Browser, Settings, and Agent Status behavior;
- `WorktreeTests`: Projects, repositories, branches, and worktrees;
- `SessionTests`: Session Snapshot and restore behavior;
- `GitStatusTests`: status parsing, Files and Changes behavior, operations, and previews;
- `TestSupport`: shared native test helpers.

Prefer behavioral tests through `@testable import Argus`. Source-contract tests are reserved for SwiftUI and AppKit wiring that cannot be observed through a stable boundary without a full UI test.

Automatic Pull Request Status networking is disabled for app instances with
`XCTestConfigurationFilePath`, `ARGUS_UNDER_TEST=1`, or
`ARGUS_DISABLE_SESSION_RESTORE=1`. Status tests inject provider/local-input
fixtures and scheduling rather than relying on live GitHub access.

## Native diff rendering

Argus renders structured diffs with the native `SwiftDiffs` package. Git Preview
Tabs keep Split and Unified layout controls; long lines scroll horizontally.
Blame previews remain ANSI text. See
`docs/adrs/0002-render-structured-diffs-with-native-swift-diffs.md` for ownership
and runtime boundaries.

## GhosttyKit

Normal builds use the vendored `Frameworks/GhosttyKit.xcframework`. Rebuilding the framework is a maintainer task and is separate from the normal application workflow. See `Frameworks/README.md` and `scripts/build-ghosttykit.sh` before changing it.

## Agent integrations

Argus installs integrations only when enabled from Settings. Kilo owns its
managed JSON/JSONC declaration and completion extension. Pi owns
`extensions/argus-agent-status.js` under the effective `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`
(or `~/.pi/agent` when the variable is unset). Existing files owned by another
program are never replaced or removed.

Restart Kilo sessions after changing the Kilo integration. Restart Pi or use
`/reload` after changing the Pi integration. Both integrations send requests to
the app-owned `~/.argus/argus.sock` endpoint, which accepts
`agent.turnCompleted`, `agent.statusChanged`, and `agent.statusCleared`. The
same socket serves the Companion CLI's Workspace Commands.

After updating Argus, enable the Pi integration again in Settings to install
its bundled extension, then restart Pi or use `/reload`. Reloading alone does
not copy the updated extension from Argus.

The Pi extension ignores processes marked with `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD=1`. When
`pi-subagents` advertises its public fleet status API, a main agent that yields
with delegated work still active stays running in Argus and produces no
completion sound or Turn Completion Attention. Completion is reported at the
next successful main-agent settlement with no active delegated work. An
advertised status API that is unsupported or fails suppresses completion;
plain Pi sessions need no subagent package.

Run the Pi lifecycle and socket transport regression tests without launching
Argus or making model calls:

```sh
node Tests/PiIntegrationTests/pi-plugin-events.mjs
```

## Companion CLI

The `argus` executable talks to a running Argus over `~/.argus/argus.sock`
(or `ARGUS_SOCKET_PATH` when Argus injected one into the shell). It resolves
nothing itself — the application owns every identity and branch decision.

Shells Argus spawns already have it on `PATH`. To use it from an ordinary
terminal, call it by its bundled path or symlink it somewhere on your own
`PATH`:

```sh
ln -sf /Applications/Argus.app/Contents/Resources/bin/argus ~/.local/bin/argus
```

Outside an Argus terminal there is no `ARGUS_WORKSPACE_ID`, so `.` has no
Workspace to resolve and the Project comes from the working directory.

```sh
# Projects and Workspaces in left-sidebar order, Stack Groups included
argus workspace list
argus workspace list --json

# A Worktree Workspace in this terminal's Project, on a generated branch
argus workspace create

# An explicit Project, branch, and Workspace name
argus workspace create --project argus --branch feature/api --name "API work"

# Stacked on this terminal's Workspace, or on a named one
argus workspace create --from . --branch feature/api-ui
argus workspace create --from feature/api --branch feature/api-ui
```

`--project` and `--from` accept an ID, an exact name (branch or display title
for `--from`), or `.` for the terminal's own context. Ambiguous references are
refused with their candidates instead of guessing.

`--from` also records `branch.<new>.base` so the pair groups as a Stack in the
sidebar. Stacking onto a Workspace on the Project's main branch records the
base but shows no Stack Group, because a Stack Group needs two open Workspaces
above a trunk branch.

Creating a Workspace does not change the Selected Workspace, so it is safe to
run from an agent's terminal. Exit codes: `0` success, `1` Argus refused the
request, `3` Argus could not be reached.

Build the CLI alone with `./scripts/build.sh cli`; `swift test` covers its
rendering and wire contract.

## Local state

Argus writes user state outside the repository:

- Session Snapshot: `~/Library/Application Support/Argus/session.json`
- Managed Worktrees: `~/.argus/worktrees/<project-uuid>/<branch-slug>/`
- App-owned socket: `~/.argus/argus.sock`

Set `ARGUS_DISABLE_SESSION_RESTORE=1` to launch without restoring the previous Session Snapshot.
